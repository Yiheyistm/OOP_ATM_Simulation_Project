# OOP_ATM_Simulation_Project
An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation is emulates the functionality of a real-world ATM system. The goal is to provide users with a virtual environment where they can perform common banking transactions without the need for a physical ATM machine. Here's a brief description of an ATM simulation project:

# Project Overview:
# 1. Purpose:

The primary purpose of the ATM simulation project is to provide users with a convenient and secure way to perform various banking transactions, such as withdrawing cash, checking account balances, transferring funds, and more.

# 2. Features:

<b>User Authentication:</b> Simulate the login process with secure authentication methods, such as PIN numbers or biometric identification.
Account Information: Display account balances, transaction history, and other relevant information.
Cash Withdrawal: Allow users to withdraw cash from their accounts, considering available balance and transaction limits.
Funds Transfer: Enable users to transfer money between their accounts or to other accounts within the bank.
Balance Inquiry: Provide a feature to check account balances and recent transactions.
Deposit Functionality: Simulate the process of depositing funds into an account, possibly through check or cash deposits.

# 3. User Interface:

Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that mimics the physical appearance of an ATM machine.
Include interactive screens for various transactions and clear instructions for users.

# 4. Security Measures:

Implement security measures to protect user data and transactions, such as encryption, secure PIN handling, and session timeouts.

# 5. Error Handling:

Develop a robust error handling mechanism to manage situations like insufficient funds, incorrect PIN entry, or system errors gracefully.
